# SCN_Matlab
This is a reimplementation of SCN-SR ([original](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~dingliu2/iccv15/)) in Matlab. And I forked the original code of [1] in "python_iccv".   
Now only test code, I am trying to implement the training code.  
Please cite [1] if you use this code in your work, thank you!
