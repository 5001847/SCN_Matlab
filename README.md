# SCN_Matlab
This is a reimplementation of SCN-SR ([original](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~dingliu2/iccv15/)) converter function, in Matlab. And I forked the original code of [1] in "python_iccv".   
Now only test code, but I will add gpu-version of test code and try to implement the training code. This code only can be used for academic, and please cite [1] if you use this code.
